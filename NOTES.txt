* General
## we can set node name to the pod, to bypass scheduler and place the pod on that node directly

* Commands
kubectl run mosquito --image nginx
kubectl run bee --image nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > bee.yml
kubectl describe node controlplane | grep Taints
kubectl taint node node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl taint node controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule- # dash in the end to remove the taint
kubectl label node node01 color=blue
kubectl create deployment blue --image nginx --replicas 3 --dry-run=client -o yaml > blue.yml
kubectl get daemonsets
kubectl get pods -o custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name,PRIORITY:.spec.priorityClassName"
kubectl create configmap --name my-scheduler-config --form-file=/root/my-scheduler-config.yaml -n kube-system
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep admission-plugins
kubectl create secret tls webhook-server-tls --cert=/root/keys/webhook-server-tls.crt --key=/root/keys/webhook-server-tls.key

* Labels and selectors
kubectl get pods --selector env=dev
kubectl get pods --selector env=test --no-headers | wc -l
kubectl get pods --selector bu=finance --no-headers | wc -l
kubectl get all --selector env=prod --no-headers | wc -l

* Taints and tolerations
# only used for restricting nodes to accept/not accept pods
## not used to tell pods to go to particular pod, instead we tell nodes to accept pods with certain tolerations
taints are set to nodes, tolerations are set to pods
kubectl describe node kubemaster | grep Taint
kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect where taint effect is one of: NoSchedule | PreferNoSchedule | NoExecute
kubectl taint node node1 app=blue:NoSchedule
# yaml for pods
tolerations:
- key: app
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "blue"
  effect: "NoSchedule"

* Node selectors
# labeling the node
## telling pods to target specific node
### we cannot utilize advanced expressions like OR or NOT using node selectors
kubectl label node node-name label-key=label-value
kubectl label node node1 size=Large
# yaml
containers:
nodeSelector:
  size: Large

* Node affinity
# ensure that the pods are hosted on particular nodes
## we can utilize advanced expressions like OR or NOT using node affinity
### node affinity types: 
 - requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
 - preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
 - (planned) requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution
# yaml
containers:
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: size
          operator: In # NotIn | Exists (values not needed for exists)
          values:
          - Large

* Node affinity with the combination of Taints and tolerations
## can be used to achive specific node selection + to avoid other pods being placed to specific nodes

* Resource requirements and limits
1G - Gigabyte = 1 000 000 000 bytes
1M - Megabyte = 1 000 000 bytes
1K - Kilobyte = 1 000 bytes

1Gi - Gibibyte = 1 073 741 824 bytes
1Mi - Mebibyte = 1 048 576 bytes
1Ki - Kibibyte = 1 024 bytes
# yaml
containers:
- name:
  image:
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 1Gi
      cpu: 1
    limits:
      memory: 2Gi
      cpu: 2
      
* LimitRange
# applicable on namespace level
# yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata: 
    name: cpu-resource-constraint
spec:
    limits:
    - default:
        cpu: 500m
      defaultRequest:
        cpu: 500m
      max:
        cpu: "1"
      min:
        cpu: 100m
      type: Container

* ResourceQuota
# set hard limits for requests and limits
## used on namespace level
# yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
    name: my-resource-quota
spec:
    hard:
      requests.cpu: 4
      requests.memory: 4Gi
      limits.cpu: 10
      limits.memory: 10Gi

* Daemonsets
# Like ReplicaSets, but runs each of the pods on a separate node
## ensures 1 copy of the pod is always present in all nodes in the cluster
kubectl get ds -a

* Static pods
# kubelet managing pods, works at pod level and can manage pods only
## manifests of the pods stored in the directory under
/etc/kubernetes/manifests
### if the manifest file gets deleted from dir, pod is also removed
#### the directory can be any directory. it is set as an argument (--pod-manifest-path) while configuring the service
#### or it can be set as within the config file, where argument is --config, the file is in .yaml format, containing staticPodPath property
#### use case - to deploy apps/pods that do not fall under k8s management
#### to identify a static pod, there will be a -<node_name> in the name of the pod, like: redis-node01
ps -aux | grep kubelet -> to identify how the service has started, check config or --pod-manifest-path to identify manifest location

* Priority classes
# make sure that high Priority workloads always get scheduled without being interrupted by low Priority workloads
# define priorities for workloads
# non-namespace objects
## priorities defined with numbers, range from -2 147 483 648 to 1 000 000 000. system apps range can go up to 2 000 000 000
kubectl get priorityclass
# yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata: 
  name: high-priority
value: 1000000000
description: "Priority class for mission critical pods"
preemptionPolicy: PreemptLowerPriority # or never
### by default pods with lover priority will be evicted from the node if no space left for new priority pods
#### to change this behavior, we can set PreemptLowerPriority to "never"
### we can also define global priority class with "globalDefault" property set to true
## associate priority class definitiona to a pod, default value is 0
## yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
  priorityClassName: high-priority
kubectl get pods -o custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name,PRIORITY:.spec.priorityClassName"

* Multiple schedulers
# we can set up multiple schedulers, they can be deployed as a pod as well
## we can instruct pods to use specific scheduler
# yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
  - schedulerName: my-scheduler-2
## yaml for pods
containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx
schedulerName: my-custom-scheduler
### to check if pod is scheduled:
kubectl get events -o wide
kubectl logs my-custom-scheduler --name-space=kube-system

* Configuring Scheduler profiles
phases of scheduling:
- Scheduling queue
- Filtering # filter nodes based on requests. nodes with insufficient resources will not be considered
- Scoring # scoring nodes, based on requests. node which has the most available resources, gets picked up
- Binding # binds pod to a node with highest score
scheduling plugins:
- Scheduling queue > PrioritySort
- Filtering > NodeResourcesFit, NodeName, NodeUnschedulable
- Scoring > NodeResourcesFit, ImageLocality
- Binding > DefaultBinder
Kubernetes allows customization of plugins.
That is achieved by Extensions Points.
Extensions:
- Scheduling queue > queueSort
- Filtering > filter
- Scoring > score
- Binding > bind

* Admission Controllers
kubectl > 
  authentication (kube config) > 
  authorization (rbac) > 
  admission controllers (enforcing rules) > 
  create pod
# view enabled admission controllers
kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
## to enable specific plugin for admission controllers
add --enable-admission-plugins argument to the kube-apiserver service start
## to disable specific plugin
add --disable-admission-plugins
### Note that the NamespaceExists and NamespaceAutoProvision admission controllers are deprecated 
  and now replaced by NamespaceLifecycle admission controller.
The NamespaceLifecycle admission controller will make sure that requests
  to a non-existent namespace is rejected and that the default namespaces such as
    default, kube-system and kube-public cannot be deleted.
# check which plugins are enabled or disabled
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep admission-plugins

* Validating and Mutating Admission Controllers
# validating addmission controllers
## validating addmission controllers are validating the request (allowed/denied)
# mutating addmission controller can change the object itself before creating it
## example: storageClass: default
### custom admission controllers:
 - MutatingAdmissionWebhook
 - ValidatingAdmissionWebhook
#### requires custom admission webhook server deployed
- requires webhook-service
- requires webhook-deployment 
-- if deployed in k8s
# yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: "pod-policy.example.com"
webhooks:
- name: "pod-policy.example.com"
  rules:
  - apiGroups:   [""]
    apiVersions: ["v1"]
    operations:  ["CREATE"]
    resources:   ["pods"]
    scope:       "Namespaced"
  clientConfig:
    # url: "https://my-server-controller" - if deployed outside k8s
    service:
      namespace: "example-namespace"
      name: "example-service"
    caBundle: <CA_BUNDLE> # cert should be added
